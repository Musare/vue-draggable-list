# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published production version is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability with a supported version please get in touch with us
via email at [core@musare.com](mailto:core@musare.com).

We endeavour to respond to reports as soon as possible, this may however take a
few days. Please refrain from reporting security issues in public forums such as
GitHub issues.

Reports will be disclosed via a security advisory once fixes are included in a
production release.
